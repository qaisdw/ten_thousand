### prompt-01 : 
> create empty  GameLogic class  with method roll_dic that generate tuple of 6 random number between 1 to 6. 

- result : 
```python
import random 
class GameLogic:
    def __init__(self):
        pass 
    def roll_dice(self):
        return tuple(random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(6))


This class initializes with an empty constructor (__init__), but you can add any necessary attributes or methods to it as your game develops. The roll_dice method uses Pythons built-in random module to generate a tuple of 6 random integers between 1 and 6 using a list comprehension and the randint function.


```

### prompt-02 :
> Add calculate_score static method to GameLogic class.
The input to calculate_score is a tuple of integers that represent a dice roll.
The output from calculate_score is an integer representing the roll’s score according to rules of game.

- result : 
```python 
import random 
class GameLogic: 

    @staticmethod 
    def calculate_score(roll):
            score = 0 counts = [roll.count(i) for i in range(1, 7)]
            # Check for three-of-a-kind or better
            if 3 in counts or 4 in counts or 5 in counts or 6 in counts:
                score += sum(roll)
            else:
            # Check for individual ones and fives
                score += counts[0] * 100 + counts[4] * 50
            # Check for specific combinations
            if counts == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]:
                score = 1500 
            elif counts == [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]:
                score = 2500
            return score

    def __init__(self):
         pass 
    def roll_dice(self):
         return tuple(random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(6)) 


This implementation adds a calculate_score static method to the GameLogic class. The method takes in a tuple roll that represents a dice roll and computes the score according to the rules of the game. The logic of the calculate_score method is based on common scoring rules for the dice game called "Farkle."
The __init__ and roll_dice methods remain unchanged from the previous example.
